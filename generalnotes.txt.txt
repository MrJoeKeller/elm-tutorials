Elm Introduction Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEitFAY7Gc8

What is ELM?
A program for no runtime exceptions in Javascript
Functional Language, statically typed
All data is immutable
All functions are 'pure'...these wont' change anything else anywhere
'null'/'undefined' exceptions do not exist

Elm has a lot of cool built in features to manage packages and immutability

Functional programming means that you don't ever get those 'broken' things
,(like null values)

Fucntional features require discipline
